# Barebones Template :cookie:

A barebones template to set up a new PyTorch DL package.

The new package can be installed using pip, and requires by default PyTorch,
Numpy, Pandas, and (optionally) Hydra.

## How to Use

Install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
navigate to the directory where the new project is created, and type on the 
command line:

```
cookiecutter gh:ri-heme/barebones
```
